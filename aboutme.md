I am a machine learning engineer who loves training deep neural networks. I have equipped a strong background in machine 
learning, deep learning algorithms, programming skills, especially mathematics and physics. 
Right now, I'm a researcher in the Robotics field at Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST). 
I got the best paper award in the ICCE 2020 conference that was held in Las Vegas, USA. 
I'd like to work in the computer vision field, especially in self-driving vehicles, human pose estimation, 
action recognition, object detection & tracking, AI for health.

I enrolled in a high school for gifted students, specializing in mathematics. During the time, I got two third prizes 
in Vietnam Physics Olympiad for high school students. In 2011, I entered an honor program designed for talented engineers
 at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

Skills: [Python, C++, C , ROS, JavaScript], [Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras]
