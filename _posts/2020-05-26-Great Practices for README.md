All projects should have READMEs which is great and explain each of the projects in detail. <br>
Documentation of the work on a Github repository through a README file is very important in this context: 
technical recruiters may or may not be programmers. Many times, they may not be able to understand code or run code. 
Even if they do, they may not want to invest time in seeing what your project looks like. READMEs are a way to immediately 
tell the recruiter how you can produce a great product or project. 
A good README is a sample reflection on the effort you'd put into a work project.
